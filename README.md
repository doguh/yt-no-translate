# YouTube No Translate

Firefox Add-On to prevent YouTube from translating videos titles.

You can install it from here: https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/youtube-no-translate/

## How it works?

Actually it does not prevent YouTube from translating, it replaces the translated title with the original one.

The original title is still here in `document.title` so we use this to replace the value of the title under the video.
